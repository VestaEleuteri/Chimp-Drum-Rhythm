  abstract = {Rhythm is ubiquitous in human culture and in nature, but hard to capture in all its complexity. A key dimension of rhythm, integer ratio categories occur when the relationship between temporal intervals can be expressed as small-integer ratios. Recent work has found integer ratio categories in most human musical cultures and some animal species' vocalizations or behavioral displays. But biological systems are noisy, and empirically measured intervals rarely form an exact small-integer ratio. Here, we mathematically assess whether the leading integer ratio analysis method makes valid statistical and biological assumptions. In particular, we (1) make the temporal properties of empirical ratios explicit, both in general and for the typical use in the literature; (2) show how the choice of ratio formula affects the probability distribution of rhythm ratios and ensuing statistical results; (3) guide the reader to carefully consider the assumptions and null hypotheses of the statistical analysis; (4) present a comprehensive methodology to statistically test integer ratios for any null hypothesis of choice. Our observations have implications for both past and future research in music cognition and animal behavior: They suggest how to interpret past findings and provide tools to choose the correct null hypotheses in future empirical work.}

  abstract = {Rhythm is a prominent feature of music. Of the infinite possible ways of organizing events in time, musical rhythms are almost always distributed categorically. Such categories can facilitate the transmission of culture---a feature that songbirds and humans share. We compared rhythms of live performances of music to rhythms of wild thrush nightingale and domestic zebra finch songs. In nightingales, but not in zebra finches, we found universal rhythm categories, with patterns that were surprisingly similar to those of music. Isochronous 1:1 rhythms were similarly common. Interestingly, a bias toward small ratios (around 1:2 to 1:3), which is highly abundant in music, was observed also in thrush nightingale songs. Within that range, however, there was no statistically significant bias toward exact integer ratios (1:2 or 1:3) in the birds. High-ratio rhythms were abundant in the nightingale song and are structurally similar to fusion rhythms (ornaments) in music. In both species, preferred rhythms remained invariant over extended ranges of tempos, indicating natural categories. The number of rhythm categories decreased at higher tempos, with a threshold above which rhythm became highly stereotyped. In thrush nightingales, this threshold occurred at a tempo twice faster than in humans, indicating weaker structural constraints and a remarkable motor proficiency. Together, the results suggest that categorical rhythms reflect similar constraints on learning motor skills across species. The saliency of categorical rhythms across humans and thrush nightingales suggests that they promote, or emerge from, the cultural transmission of learned vocalizations. Video Abstract},
